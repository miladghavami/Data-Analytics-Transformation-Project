# Data Analytics & Transformation Challenges
This project showcases a collection of real-world data challenges completed as part of a hands-on learning series focused on SQL, Excel, Power Query, and VBA. The goal was to replicate common business tasks related to data cleaning, querying, transformation, and reporting.

# üìÅ Project Files
The repository includes the following:

Excel Files: Datasets used in each challenge (e.g., OrderData_end.xlsx, ChallengeData_End.xlsx)

Access Database: LearnData.accdb used for SQL-based challenges

Power Query Workbooks: Examples of transformation logic based on VBA cleaning routines

## üöÄ Challenges Completed
# 1. Reading and Debugging SQL
Reviewed and interpreted SQL statements.

Identified syntax and logic errors and corrected them for accurate results.

# 2. Uncategorized Products
Used SQL LEFT JOIN queries to isolate products without subcategories from a relational database.

# 3. Renaming Headers in Power Query
Analyzed existing VBA code logic in Excel.

Recreated dynamic data cleaning logic in Power Query for automation and reusability.

##  4. Sales Summary Report
Combined customer first and last names with keys into unified identifiers.

Converted data types (e.g., numeric to text).

Aggregated order data to compute total products sold and total sales amount per product.

##  üõ† Tools & Technologies
# SQL (MS Access)

# Power Query

# Excel (VBA Macros)

# Data Modeling and Cleaning

# acess

##  üìå Key Learnings
Practical use of joins and aggregations in SQL for business reporting.

Translating procedural VBA logic into no-code Power Query transformations.

Creating clean, analysis-ready datasets from raw data sources.

## ‚úÖ How to Use
Open the .accdb file using Microsoft Access to review SQL queries.

Open the Excel files to view transformation steps in Power Query and VBA.

Review cleaned and transformed data outputs in *_end.xlsx files.
